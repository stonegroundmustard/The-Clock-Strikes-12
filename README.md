# The Mouse Goes Up the Clock

## Description

The ulterior motive of this project was to create a free scheduling template for MYSELF for a scheduling planner because to be honest, the ones online are too posh and expensive. Creating this work day schedule was to put the fewest words: easier said than done. The third party API's were very helpful, but severly lacking in overall style. My TA Jonny told me this was an issue with using Bootstrap and JQuery and it held true. I ultimately learned to lean on my peers and push through even if I'm not totally satisfied with the appearance. I'm looking forward to down the road when I can learn more to help this template fit mine and maybe other's needs.
